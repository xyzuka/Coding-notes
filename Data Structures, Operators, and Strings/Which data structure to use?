WHICH DATA STRUCTURE SHOULD YOU USE?

SOURCES OF DATA
- From the program itself, written into the source code
- From UI, user inputs
- From external sources, fetched from APIs (Application Programming Interface)

We do we store this data? With data structures!

FOUR TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURES
- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

WHICH ONE TO USE?
- If your data is a simple list: Use Arrays or Sets
- If your data needs a key or value pairs: Use Objects or Maps - keys allow us to describe values

WHEN TO USE THEM?
1. ARRAYS
- Use when you need ordered list of values (may contain duplicates)
- Use when you need to manipulate data

2. SETS
- Use when working with unique values
- Use when high-performance is really important
- Use to remove duplicates from arrays

3. OBJECTS
- Use when you need to include functions (methods)
- Use when working with JSON (can convert to map)

4. MAPS
- Use when you need to simply map key to values
- Use when you need keys that are NOT strings
